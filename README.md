# Bachelor_Thesis

This is my Bachelor Thesis Repository, repository contains Python code and my bachelor thesis paper.

In Summary, My Thesis can be described as The implementation of Machine Learning for Petroleum Engineering Problems.

In this Thesis, I implemented a total of three different Supervised Learning (Classification) Algorithm, with a final accuracy of around 90% in the case study, using KNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network). Workflow includes Data gathering and cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model training, validation, and Testing, and Model evaluation by Hyperparameter optimization. 

Raw Data is included for reproducible research, any sensitive information regarding the data has been removed and masked
